I have spent several hours on this project: I wanted to make a gift for my wife that is romantic, original, and pretty geeky. As a student and hobbyist studying software engineering, I love any excuse to learn more about programming. On a technical level, I have gained a deeper understanding of common Linux commands and tools while developing this little program.

Geeky Stuff:
This project is a Bash script that is called by the cron daemon: it will be run on my home LAMP server. The program is called daily and parses two files: first it checks if today is a notable date (e.g. anniversary, birthday, etc.) and if so, sends a special message to her phone; if not, the program will send a random (and admittedly romantic and adorable) message on three random days in any given week.
